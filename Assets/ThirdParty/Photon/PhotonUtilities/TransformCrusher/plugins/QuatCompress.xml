            <summary>
            This compression is based on the smallest three method of compressing Quaternions. Supply the Quaterion and the number of /bits you want it reduced to.
            2 bits are used to identify which channel of xyzw was left out and needs to be reconstructed.

            Cache's the inverse of all of the max values, used by decompress to avoid division and just generally minimize the math in the hotpath.

            Primary Compression Method. Converts a quaternion into a ulong buffer. Depending on size most of the top bits will be 0.

            <summary>
            Compress to a 32 bit UInt. NOTE: 32 bits is medium compression (25% of the original Quaternion), small rounding errors 
            (averaging around .25°) may be noticable. 
            For flawless compression, use CompressToULong or compress to byte[] using a bitcount in the range of 40 to 48 bits (Pro version only).

            <summary>
            Compress to a 16 bit UInt. NOTE: 16 bits is heavy compression (12.5% of the original Quaternion), this will not rotate smoothly 
            and is only good for very rough rotation syncing. 
            For flawless compression, use CompressToULong or compress to a byte[] or the Ulong buffer using a bitcount in the range of 40 to 50 bits.

            Writes the quat to a byte[] array. WARNING: this byte[] is reused every time QuatCompress is compresses a quaternion to byte[], so be sure to use
            the contents immediately (copy them to your bitstream, byte array or wherever the data is going. If you need to queue byte arrays for later writing
            use the CompressToByteArrayNonAlloc variation and supply a byte[].
